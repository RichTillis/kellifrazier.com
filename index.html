                All students have a right to an equitable free and appropriate
                public education with differentiated instruction to meet
                individual learning needs. The environment in which students are
                taught should have a safe, encouraging atmosphere. Education
                should focus on developing the whole child, teaching academic,
                social, and emotional learning for all. An inherent culture of
                discourse, critical thinking, and independence should exist.
                Learning should be made relevant to students’ lives and
                application of skills practiced in multiple settings, not just in
                a classroom. All individuals, students, staff, and families,
                should be encouraged to reflect on practice and growth. To lead
                meaningful change, reflection should be on all levels of learning
                and guided by the use of data to make an informed plan for change.

                Furthermore, I believe that every student has the ability to learn
                and be successful. In order to create an atmosphere conducive to
                learning, students must feel comfortable taking risks. Therefore,
                I strive to foster a school and classroom community where students
                and families feel safe and supported. In addition, families and
                students each bring a unique set of skills and experiences to the
                school and classroom and learn best in varying ways due to
                different learning styles, interests, and preferences. I embrace
                these differences and use them to strengthen learning experiences
                in my school and classrooms. I set high expectations for each and
                every one of my staff members as well as students, while providing
                the structure and guidance necessary to achieve success.

                As an educational leader, I develop and communicate a clear vision
                for all stakeholders and provide a path to accomplishing the
                mission of Gateway Polytechnic Academy. This includes an ability
                to express and inspire all stakeholders to meet the needs of all
                students. It is essential each student is met with cultural
                competence and equity in learning while being shown compassion.
                All students’ learning should focus on academic, social, and
                emotional development. All stakeholders need to be passionate
                about the learning process not solely focused on outcomes. The
                vision and mission identifies who the individuals are and what
                each one wants to develop into as staff, students, parents,
                families, and community. As a leader, I inspire commitment from
                staff and also develop trust from all stakeholders. It is
                important to do this with transparency and in an easy to
                understand language defining ourselves with our values, attitude,
                vision and measure of success.

                All children can learn when provided opportunities and instruction
                which meet their individual learning styles and needs. Instruction
                provided using research-based strategies and differentiated for
                individual student needs will allow students to find success. It
                is a leader’s responsibility to build capacity for all learners in
                problem solving issues in society, contributing to the well-being
                of humanity, and develop opportunities for self-fulfillment. A
                school has to promote learning that is relevant to the lives of
                its students. Learning and knowledge have to be applicable to what
                students experience daily. Instructional leaders need to provide
                supervision and evaluations which encourage teachers to be
                classroom leaders; teachers are part of a system that has to have
                a belief all students are “our kids” not just “my students.”

                Data collection and progress monitoring are essential tools in
                learning. Analyzing data gives guidance on areas of growth and
                need by identifying strengths and weaknesses. Data collection
                should minimize impact on direct instruction while assisting teams
                in pinpointing topics for professional development. Professional
                development should relate directly to student and staff
                performance and requires opportunities to learn, practice, get
                feedback, and implement skills and strategies. Teachers need to be
                exposed to different types of assessment and encouraged to use
                them as a means to determine learning while believing they can
                utilize them and take risks just as professionals should be
                encouraging students. Technologies can be used in teaching and
                learning as a means of making learning and information more
                relevant to how students experience their world today.

                School leaders should encourage all learners to be in school daily
                and provide a safe, nurturing environment. School safety and

                where students want to attend. Individual actions and attitudes
                create a powerful force for school climate. A crucial decision as
                a leader is selecting professionals who will provide support and
                lead the school community with a determination focused on the
                vision, mission, and safety of all stakeholders. It is the
                leader’s responsibility to develop commitment and loyalty to the
                vision with words and actions. A belief in learning with
                risk-taking should be reinforced for students and staff while
                being empowered to explore and use their new knowledge and skills
                in new and innovative ways. All stakeholders are responsible for

                Schools are an integral part of the community in preparing
                students as relevant members of society. The interactions between
                a school and community are at the core of a belief that it takes a
                village to raise and develop our young members which is the core
                purpose of a school and the community. The community’s connection
                and involvement with the school is imperative in supporting
                student success. School leaders at all levels and community
                stakeholders have an interest in developing a relationship built
                on transparency and trust. As a leader, it will be a priority to
                establish visibility, communication, and involvement with the
                community. A school leader has to value, not in what ways, but in
                all ways the relationship between the school and community
                stakeholders promotes student growth, achievement, and success as
                learners and members of society.

                A leader must demonstrate and model clear ethical standards for
                the entire school community. A leader’s ethical compass should
                always face “north;” everyone has an ability to advance, do
                better, learn, adapt, and grow. If a leader follows the compass,
                improvement and learning follow. A school leader should not ask
                others to do what she or he wouldn’t do themselves. A belief that
                all stakeholders should advocate and defend social justice for all
                members of its community and society as a whole should be
                ingrained in the culture of the school. All stakeholders deserve
                privacy and it should be protected, not marginalized or made
                dependent on situations. All stakeholders should be given the
                inalienable right of self-determination; individuals have an
                ability to make decisions for themselves. A school leader should
                continuously promote and communicate that the concepts of fair,
                equal, and equitable are all different, but that all stakeholders
                are given these without question.
