          Leader / Educator / Influencer
        </h3>
        <div>
          <h5><u>Educational Philosophy</u></h5>
          <p class="lead text-justify text-muted">
            All students have a right to an equitable free and appropriate
            public education with differentiated instruction to meet
            individual learning needs. The environment in which students are
            taught should have a safe, encouraging atmosphere. Education
            should focus on developing the whole child, teaching academic,
            social, and emotional learning for all. An inherent culture of
            discourse, critical thinking, and independence should exist.
            Learning should be made relevant to students’ lives and
            application of skills practiced in multiple settings, not just in
            a classroom. All individuals, students, staff, and families,
            should be encouraged to reflect on practice and growth. To lead
            meaningful change, reflection should be on all levels of learning
            and guided by the use of data to make an informed plan for change.
          </p>

          <p class="lead text-justify text-muted">
            Furthermore, I believe that every student has the ability to learn
            and be successful. In order to create an atmosphere conducive to
            learning, students must feel comfortable taking risks. Therefore,
            I strive to foster a school and classroom community where students
            and families feel safe and supported. In addition, families and
            students each bring a unique set of skills and experiences to the
            school and classroom and learn best in varying ways due to
            different learning styles, interests, and preferences. I embrace
            these differences and use them to strengthen learning experiences
            in my school and classrooms. I set high expectations for each and
            every one of my staff members as well as students, while providing
            the structure and guidance necessary to achieve success.
          </p>

          <h5><u>Leadership Philosophy</u></h5>
          <p class="lead text-justify text-muted">
            As an educational leader, I develop and communicate a clear vision
            for all stakeholders and provide a path to accomplishing the
            mission of Gateway Polytechnic Academy. This includes an ability
            to express and inspire all stakeholders to meet the needs of all
            students. It is essential each student is met with cultural
            competence and equity in learning while being shown compassion.
            All students’ learning should focus on academic, social, and
            emotional development. All stakeholders need to be passionate
            about the learning process not solely focused on outcomes. The
            vision and mission identifies who the individuals are and what
            each one wants to develop into as staff, students, parents,
            families, and community. As a leader, I inspire commitment from
            staff and also develop trust from all stakeholders. It is
            important to do this with transparency and in an easy to
            understand language defining ourselves with our values, attitude,
            vision and measure of success.
          </p>

          <h5><u>Promoting Student Learning and Professional Growth</u></h5>
          <p class="lead text-justify text-muted">
            All children can learn when provided opportunities and instruction
            which meet their individual learning styles and needs. Instruction
            provided using research-based strategies and differentiated for
            individual student needs will allow students to find success. It
            is a leader’s responsibility to build capacity for all learners in
            problem solving issues in society, contributing to the well-being
            of humanity, and develop opportunities for self-fulfillment. A
            school has to promote learning that is relevant to the lives of
            its students. Learning and knowledge have to be applicable to what
            students experience daily. Instructional leaders need to provide
            supervision and evaluations which encourage teachers to be
            classroom leaders; teachers are part of a system that has to have
            a belief all students are “our kids” not just “my students.”
          </p>

          <p class="lead text-justify text-muted">
            Data collection and progress monitoring are essential tools in
            learning. Analyzing data gives guidance on areas of growth and
            need by identifying strengths and weaknesses. Data collection
            should minimize impact on direct instruction while assisting teams
            in pinpointing topics for professional development. Professional
            development should relate directly to student and staff
            performance and requires opportunities to learn, practice, get
            feedback, and implement skills and strategies. Teachers need to be
            exposed to different types of assessment and encouraged to use
            them as a means to determine learning while believing they can
            utilize them and take risks just as professionals should be
            encouraging students. Technologies can be used in teaching and
            learning as a means of making learning and information more
            relevant to how students experience their world today.
          </p>

          <h5><u>School Management and Organization</u></h5>
          <p class="lead text-justify text-muted">
            School leaders should encourage all learners to be in school daily
            and provide a safe, nurturing environment. School safety and
            effective management are essential in creating an environment
            where students want to attend. Individual actions and attitudes
            create a powerful force for school climate. A crucial decision as
            a leader is selecting professionals who will provide support and
            lead the school community with a determination focused on the
            vision, mission, and safety of all stakeholders. It is the
            leader’s responsibility to develop commitment and loyalty to the
            vision with words and actions. A belief in learning with
            risk-taking should be reinforced for students and staff while
            being empowered to explore and use their new knowledge and skills
            in new and innovative ways. All stakeholders are responsible for
            problem solving and to develop continuous school improvement.
          </p>

          <h5><u>Vision for School and Community Relations</u></h5>
          <p class="lead text-justify text-muted">
            Schools are an integral part of the community in preparing
            students as relevant members of society. The interactions between
            a school and community are at the core of a belief that it takes a
            village to raise and develop our young members which is the core
            purpose of a school and the community. The community’s connection
            and involvement with the school is imperative in supporting
            student success. School leaders at all levels and community
            stakeholders have an interest in developing a relationship built
            on transparency and trust. As a leader, it will be a priority to
            establish visibility, communication, and involvement with the
            community. A school leader has to value, not in what ways, but in
            all ways the relationship between the school and community
            stakeholders promotes student growth, achievement, and success as
            learners and members of society.
          </p>

          <h5><u>Ethical Leadership</u></h5>
          <p class="lead text-justify text-muted">
            A leader must demonstrate and model clear ethical standards for
            the entire school community. A leader’s ethical compass should
            always face “north;” everyone has an ability to advance, do
            better, learn, adapt, and grow. If a leader follows the compass,
            improvement and learning follow. A school leader should not ask
            others to do what she or he wouldn’t do themselves. A belief that
            all stakeholders should advocate and defend social justice for all
            members of its community and society as a whole should be
            ingrained in the culture of the school. All stakeholders deserve
            privacy and it should be protected, not marginalized or made
            dependent on situations. All stakeholders should be given the
            inalienable right of self-determination; individuals have an
            ability to make decisions for themselves. A school leader should
            continuously promote and communicate that the concepts of fair,
            equal, and equitable are all different, but that all stakeholders
            are given these without question.

      <h5><u>About Me</u></h5>
      <p class="lead text-muted">
        I was born and grew up in the beautiful state of Texas. I grew up
        playing soccer and was forced to do track (not my favorite). My
        husband, Michael, and I have three children, Wyatt, Holden, and Nixon.
        We love the outdoors, hiking, camping, and being with my family.
      </p>
      <h5><u>Education</u></h5>
      <p class="lead text-muted">
        I began my career as a 4th grade teacher, then wanted to try 2nd
        grade. I was approached my 6th year teaching to become our schools
        reading interventionist. Two years after being the reading
        interventionist, the site principal wanted me to become the program
        facilitator. I humbly accepted. Shortly after I moved to Mesa, AZ
        where I began my career with Queen Creek Unified School District as
        Data specialist. I then became the Dean and currently serve as the
        TOSA. I am a proud graduate of Northern Arizona University where I
        earned a BA in Elementary Education, an MA in Educational Leadership.
      </p>
      <h5><u>QCUSD</u></h5>
      <p class="lead text-muted">
        I have dedicated my life to providing opportunities for all students
        to learn what their passion is and gain the education and confidence
        to find success in it. I have loved working for Queen Creek Unified
        School District because of its deep commitment to student success,
        clear focus on achievement, and wide array of extra-curricular
        opportunities. These things all align in a coherent effort to serve
        all students well. Working in the capacity as a principal for a school
        district like Queen Creek would be an incredible honor for me.
